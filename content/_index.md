# Vansh's Tech Notes

I am vansh. I like niche books and generic comedy movies.

Here are some blogs and books that I discovered either during or right after college. They heavily inspired this blog and my writing style in general.

**_Blogs_**:
- https://brooker.co.za/blog/
- https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/
- https://gregbrockman.com/

**_Books_**:
- Born Standing Up, _Steve Martin_
- My Years at General Motors, _Alfred P. Sloan_
- The Argumentative Indian, _Amartya Sen_
- [Bossypants](https://www.bigbencomedy.com/archives/bossypants-quotes/), _Tina Fey_ (this is admittedly an odd one, but few people have reduced something as ambgious as comdey into a formula and yet kept the creative magic alive)


As of 2025, my blog is still sparse, but I like to keep a list of pending posts here for accountability:
- ~AI Safety is Not Above Your Paygrade~
- ~UX/Inuition/LLM/Co-Star(?)~
- LLM/Memory/Evals
- Review of Steve Martin's 'Born Standing Up'
