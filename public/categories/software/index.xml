      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A computer can never be held accountable; therefore, a computer must never make a management decision. — &lt;em&gt;IBM Training Manual, 1979&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I never took AI safety seriously. It always seemed beyond pay grade or reserved for activists, like nuclear energy or the middle east.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That changed earlier this year when I built a text-based query platform for a customer.

The pimp tracking his girls in the wild west was really just doing b2b saas with human as a controller. You scoff, but almost every succesfull YC startup was once a precocious founder with an excel sheet (see: vanta).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But modern business software runs on computers and boils down to 3 components:&lt;/p&gt;</description>
