      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;millennials-and-the-magic-wand&#34;&gt;Millennials and the Magic Wand&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sam Altman, the YC guy? Before there was OpenAI, there was Loopt, before there were LLMs, there was ML, and before there was chat, there was the &lt;code&gt;magic wand&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;2010s were a vibe, money was free and the jeans were skinny. The magic wand in a way accurately captures the mood of the decade. You&amp;rsquo;d digitize a niche, sprinkle a Bayes classifier, slap the wand label and raise a million dollar seed in the name of ML. Quick and lazy, and it worked until it didn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
