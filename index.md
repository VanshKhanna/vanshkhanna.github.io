Hi!

I am vansh. I like niche books and generic comedy movies. This techincal blog/personal website is heavily inspired by the blogs listed below, before you read mine, you should probably read theirs. I discovered all three of these, along with select few books, within 1 year of graduating college and have since heavily shaped my techincal style and world view.

- https://brooker.co.za/blog/
- https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/
- https://gregbrockman.com/

As of 2025, my blog is still sparse, but I like to keep a list of pending posts here for accountability:
- AI Safety is Not Above Your Paygrade
- Review of Steve Martin's 'Born Standing Up'
- LLM/Memory/Evals
